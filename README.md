# bad crumple

A friend was adding a (different, better) crumple effect to his portfolio website, and I wanted to see how well LLMs would fare creating it. 35 minutes of prompting resulted in this, which seems pretty impressive for the time it took + the complete lack of brain power required on my part. 

Process: 
1. Have windsurf.ai create a simple lorem-ipsum website with two pages 
2. Have windsurf.ai add a simple fade-in transition effect. 
3. Prompt o1 to guide an engineer to replace it with a page-rotation effect.
4. Have windsurf.ai follow o1's instructions and create a page-rotation effect. 
5. Prompt o1 to guide an engineer to replace that with a crumple effect. 
6. Have windsurf.ai follow o1's instructions and create a crumple effect.
